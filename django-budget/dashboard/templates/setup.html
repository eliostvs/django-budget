    Before you can start using this application, we need to put together
    a budget. Three quick steps and you'll be ready to start using
    everything. You can come back to this screen at any time to make
    changes or add new items.
    {% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<h3>{% trans "Step 1. Create Categories" %}</h3>

<p>
    {% blocktrans %}
    Before we can put together the budget, we need categories to tie
    the incomes/expenses you enter to the line items in your budget.
    Nothing more than a descriptive name is required for each category,
    though you may want to err on the side of being a little broad
    when naming the category.
    {% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<p>
    <a class="btn btn-primary" href="{% url 'category:category_list' %}">{% trans "View/Add Categories" %}</a>
</p>

<h3>{% trans "Step 2. Create A Budget" %}</h3>

<p>
    {% blocktrans %}
        Once you have a couple categories in place, we can create a budget.
        Again, not a lot of information is needed here, just a name and when
        you'd like the budget to start being used. This application always
        tries to use the most recent budget for whatever date is chosen.
    {% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<p>
    <a class="btn btn-primary btn-success" href="{% url 'budget:budget_list' %}">{% trans "View/Add Budgets" %}</a>
</p>

<h3>{% trans "Step 3. Create Budget Estimates" %}</h3>

<p>
    {% blocktrans %}
        The last step is to create the line items that make up a budget. To do
        this, we'll tie together the budget the estimate applies to, the
        category it covers and how much you'd like to allocate to that type of
        expense per month.
    {% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<p>
    {% blocktrans %}
        To view/add estimates, go into the Budget list and click the
        "View/Add Estimates" link on the budget you'd like to work with.
    {% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<p>
    <a class="btn btn-info" href="{% url 'budget:budget_list' %}">{% trans "View/Add Estimates Within A Budget" %}</a>
</p>

<h3>{% trans "Step 4. All Set!" %}</h3>

<p>
    {% blocktrans %}
        You can now use the rest of the application. You'll probably want to
        start with the "Transactions" area to add some incomes/expenses, then
        go to the "Dashboard" for an overview or "Summaries" for more detail.
